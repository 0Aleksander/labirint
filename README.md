# labirint/maze
This project is one of many for my class NSA4. It generates a random maze on a web page and provides an animation to find the solution path. You can interact with it by clicking a button to generate a new maze and another button to animate the solution path with a effect once the solution reaches the end.

Features
Random Maze Generation: Generates a random maze.
Maze Animation: Animates the solution path step by step.
Blinking Solution Path: Once the solution path is completed, the path blinks to indicate the end.
Responsive Design: The maze adjusts to different screen sizes.

Usage
Generate Maze: Click the "Generate New Maze" button to generate a new random maze.
Animate Solution: Click the "Animate Solution" button to animate the solution path.
Customization
Maze Size: You can change the maze size by adjusting the cols and rows values in script.js.
Cell Size: The cellSize variable in script.js determines the size of each cell in the maze. Adjust this to change the appearance of the maze.
Animation Speed: The speed of the animation is controlled by the stepDelay variable in script.js. Increase the delay for a slower animation.
