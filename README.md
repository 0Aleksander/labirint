# labirint/maze
This project is one of many for my class NSA4. It shows a maze on a web page and provides an animation to find the solution path. You can interact with it by clicking a button to animate the solution path with a effect once the solution reaches the end.

Features
Maze Animation: Animates the solution path step by step.
Responsive Design: The maze adjusts to different screen sizes.
